# 🐾 tinsy (work in progress)

A JSON format for creating [Bitsy](http://bitsy.org) games. Will convert the JSON into valid Bitsy game data - however the "textures" have to be provided separately by the user.

I created this so that I can create generators that can generate Bitsy games!

Does not support all of Bitsy's features.
